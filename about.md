My name is Asapanna Rakesh, you can call me Rakesh. I am a machine learning practitioner, developer and a research engineer with demonstrated history of working in industry scale machine learning projects. I love implementing machine learning algorithms and build products that matter.

In the past I’ve been:

• Core ML Engineer for India's largest geo-mapping company
• Product-contributor for multiple startups
• Google AI machine learning facilitator
• Augmented reality developer for video-tech startup
• 2019 Code-In Mentor for Tensorflow
• Invited to Google office to present my startup for funding
• Incuabatee for a failed start-up
• Speaker, mentor and member for multiple tech communities
• Engineer intern at Logitech International SA
• Contributor for google/flax deep learning library in JAX
• Freelancer, independent consultant and much more …

Euphoric intersection of research, engineering and product development in the field of machine learning and data science excite me. I believe in open-source / democratizing machine learning and love finding meaning to equations.

Currently I am building govai.in for affordable AI and quantum tech in India (releasing on 29th July 2022).

Thank you for your time. Hope to meet you someday :)
