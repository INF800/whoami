## Background

I was reading *[High Performance Python, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-python/9781492055013/)* and a small snippet shown below resonated with me, my thoughts and my hustle since past couple of years.

Hopefully this **list of small yet meaningful wins** will not only bring joy back into my work but also into my life.

### Soul.

**23rd July 2022:** [*Naradha*, the timeless sage's desciption of Shri *Ram*](https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=1&language=dv&field_sarga_value=1) is what one must call *An Ideal*. And be it fate, I happen to be *A Dasudu* (Meaning bondman, deacon, devotee, servant or slave to my family God Shri *Ram*) and it is in my lineage to (literally) dance with the Fire God for him.

**24th July 2022:** Kishore (Father of Athreya & a very good Product Engineer at Logitech) told me once that he sees *Fire* in me, and asked me to not let go of it. My *Soul* must learn to conquer that *Fire* within and to me that is what *Dancing With Fire* means.

### Mind & Body.

**4th July 2022:** Since 2018, I have abused my body; since 2019 I am abusing my mind. As of today, I can build lakhs of rupees worth software in a single month. *ASAP* is in my name. But, I forgot my blood brother's birthday yesterday - This is not what I intend to become. It's time that I acively focus on my *mind & body*. Even my parents want me to do so, with their help, I hope to get back in shape.

### No Ordinary Moments.

**22nd May 2022:** Almost two years back I lost my watch & wallet to greed. My brother bought me a brand new watch today.

### Right Place.

**March 2020:** Early in my career after working 1.5 years alone for my own startup I was fortunate enough to realise that it isn't the code that I write keeps me happy; It is the people with whom I write it with.
