## Background

I was reading *[High Performance Python, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-python/9781492055013/)* and a small snippet shown below resonated with me, my thoughts and my hustle since past two years.

Hopefully this list of small and meaningful wins will not only bring joy back into my work but also into my life.

**22nd May 2022:** Almost two years I lost my watch & wallet to greed. Two years later, I am wearing a new watch - gifted by my brother. Somethings are worth more than you know.
