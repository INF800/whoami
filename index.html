		Ramanujam used to show his notes to me, but I was rarely able to make head or tail of at least some of the things he had written. One day he was explaining a relation to me; then he suddenly turned round and said, "Sir, an equation has no meaning for me unless it expresses a thought of GOD."<br/>
		I was simply stunned. Since then I had meditated over this remark times without number. To me, that single remark was the essence of Truth about God, Man and the Universe. In that statement, I saw the real Ramanujam, the philosopher mystic-mathematician.
