## Background

I was reading *[High Performance Python, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-python/9781492055013/)* and a small snippet shown below resonated with me, my thoughts and my hustle since past two years.

Hopefully this list of small and meaningful wins will not only bring joy back into my work but also into my life.


### No Ordinary Moments.

**22nd May 2022:** Almost two years back my watch was stolen along with my wallet. I saw the theif again after couple of months in a completely different area in traffic but decided not to make a big deal out of it.
Two years later, I am wearing a new watch - gifted by my brother. Hopefully it will keep on reminding me that **there are no ordinary moments.**
