My name is Asapanna Rakesh, you can call me Rakesh.
I’m a self-taught programmer and ML practitioner currently living in India. In the past I’ve been:

- Google AI machine learning facilitator
- 2019 Code-In Mentor for Tensorflow
- Invited to Google office to present my startup for funding
- Incuabatee for a failed start-up
- Speaker and product-contributor for communities and startups
- Product engineer intern at Logitech 
- Freelancer and much more ...

Euphoric intersection of research, engineering and product development in the field of machine learning and data science excite me. I believe in democratizing machine learning / open-source and love finding meaning to equations (check my blog). 

I am humble and sincere and understanding. I prefer to not to talk much but when it comes to tech, I am the most friendliest person on the internet! 

To know the tools, technologies and programming languages I use, check out my sourcerer stats. If you intend to hire me, you can find my resume here.

Thank you for your time. Hope to meet you someday :)
