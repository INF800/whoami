## Objective function & it's significance

Before we start, understanding the objective function is critical to model building task. 
Here, we are optimizing for RMSE. Unlike MSE, RMSE is in same scale as the target variable.

## Handle missing values and clean the data

We will focus only on model building. To not over complicate things, let us assume data is clean and there are no missing values. [This dataset from tabular series fits our needs](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-aug-2021)!

## Model building

..And feature engineering if applicabel

0. Random baseline
1. Using automl
