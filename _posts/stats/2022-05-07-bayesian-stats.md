## 1. L1 Background

### A. Rules of Probability

These are undeniable.

- Every *event* has *probability* associated with it.

>  *Event* is written in captial letter. If $$X$$ is probability of a coin falling with heads ($$H$$) or tails ($$T$$), we can represent it as
> $$
> \begin{align}
> P(X  &= H) &= \frac{1}{2} \tag{1} \label{eq:heads} \\
> P(X  &= T) &= \frac{1}{2} \tag{2} \label{eq:tails} \\
> \end{align}
> $$
