## Setup `eth-brownie`

Let us build a simple web3 application using **Brownie** and **Ganache** for *simple storage application* which stores any given value.

create a folder for project and then open vs code in that directory.

```
mkdir brownie_simple_storage
code brownie_simple_storage
```

(Recommended) Install brownie with `pipx` for virtual environment. 

Just go to the terminal and run the following:

```
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath 
```

And then install brownie.

```
pipx install eth-brownie
```

Check if installed correctly using 

```
brownie --version
```

## Setup Ganache

Install ganache from it's website and spawn a local blockchain for development purposes.

## Create a Project

Required steps:

1. Create folder structure
2. Write a contract 
3. Compile the contract
4. Write deployment script


Run ```brownie init``` to create a series of folders for project. It may create the following folders:

```
+ build 
    + contracts     (saves all built contracts)
    + deployments   (automates all deployments)
    + interfaces    
+ contracts         (all contracts are written here)
+ interfaces        (makes it super easy to interact with other apps)
+ reports           (basic reports)
+ scripts           (automation scripts)
+ tests             (tests all contracts)
+ .gitattributes
+ .gitignore
```

Then write your contract in the `contracts` folder in main level.

`contracts/SimpleStorage.sol`
```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

contract SimpleStorage {

    uint256 favoriteNumber;

    // This is a comment!
    struct People {
        uint256 favoriteNumber;
        string name;
    }

    People[] public people;
    mapping(string => uint256) public nameToFavoriteNumber;

    function store(uint256 _favoriteNumber) public {
        favoriteNumber = _favoriteNumber;
    }
    
    function retrieve() public view returns (uint256){
        return favoriteNumber;
    }

    function addPerson(string memory _name, uint256 _favoriteNumber) public {
        people.push(People(_favoriteNumber, _name));
        nameToFavoriteNumber[_name] = _favoriteNumber;
    }
}
```

and then run

```
brownie compile
```

You may see `json` file for the contracts in the contracts dir.


### Deployment Script

goto `scripts` folder and write a simple deployment script. 

> In `web3.py` version we did everything manually which are automated for us.
> - Compilation
> - Dumped to a file
> - ABI & Bytecode
> - Spawing & stopping ganache
> - Get private & public addresses
> - deploy simple storage

`scripts/deploy.py`

```
```

and run `brownie run scripts/deploy.py`

> brownie independantly create a ganache server and turns it down after use. Everything is made simple for us.
