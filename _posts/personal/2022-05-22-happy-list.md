## Background

I was reading *[High Performance Python, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-python/9781492055013/)* and a small snippet shown below resonated with me, my thoughts and my hustle since past couple of years.

Hopefully this **list of small yet meaningful wins** will not only bring joy back into my work but also into my life.

### Home.

**16th June 2022:** I decided that I will stay home closer to my family and *rebuild* myself.

### No Ordinary Moments.

**22nd May 2022:** Almost two years back I lost my watch & wallet to greed. My brother bought me a brand new watch today.

### Right Place.

**March 2020:** Early in my career after working 1.5 years alone for my own startup I was fortunate enough to realise that it isn't the code that I write keeps me happy; It is the people with whom I write it with.
