## Background

I was reading *[High Performance Python, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-python/9781492055013/)* and a small snippet shown below resonated with me, my thoughts and my hustle since past couple of years.

Hopefully this **list of small yet meaningful wins** will not only bring joy back into my work but also into my life.

### Cutting Free.

**09 August 2022:** The leap of *blind faith* costs **courage**. Bravery is an easy *reality*, but courage is the gift of *realisation* — not everyone can *afford* to take gifts from the *unknown* & the madness that entails it.

Some stones (*pages of life*) must be left unturned because the *lesson is simple yet the student is complicated.*

### The Offence.

**01 August 2022:** I still remember the day when my roommates (from village) came to a common agreement that I will thrive in a city environment but can never live a village life. It offends you when someone says you cannot live at your *own* home.

**05 August 2022:** It offends you even more when you *yourself* believe it so. Thanks to Covid, staying *home* forever with *my* family is an option now.

### Enough.

**28 July 2019:** What does it mean when (even if you want to,) you are not able to do things that you are *capable* of doing? Goals are not clearly defined. Goals can only be defined when you know what you want & when you know when it is *enough*.

*Life's under no obligation to give us what we <s>expect</s>* deserve. I *need* nothing, yet I will set things straight just because I am *capable* of it.

### The Need.

In the Socratic dialogue *‘Republic’*, Plato famously wrote: *“our need will be the real creator”* (Wikipedia.org, 2020) which was moulded over time into the English proverb *‘Necessity is the mother of invention’*.

*His* words run **deep**: *"I know this is not appropriate to say but without Covid, I think I woudn't have taken such an action."* **Darkness** has a *Way* of teaching us things that nobody may even *dare to learn.* 

When I get my life in order I may gift myself with these three *Blue Denim* jeans - 1. Iron Heart, 2. Samurai, and 3. TCB.

### The Soul.

**23rd July 2022:** [*Naradha*, the timeless sage's desciption of Shri *Ram*](https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=1&language=dv&field_sarga_value=1) is what one must call *An Ideal*. And be it fate, I happen to be *A Dasudu* (Meaning bondman, deacon, devotee, servant or slave to my family God Shri *Ram*) and it is in my lineage to (literally) dance with the [Fire God](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agni) for him.

**24th July 2022:** Kishore (Father of Athreya & a *commendable* Product Engineer at Logitech) told me once that he sees *Fire* in me, and asked me to not let go of it. My *Soul* must learn to conquer that *Fire* within and to me that is what *Dancing With Fire* means.

### Mind & Body.

**4th July 2022:** Since 2018, I have abused my body; since 2019 I am abusing my mind. As of today, I can build lakhs of rupees worth software in a single month. *ASAP* is in my name. But, I forgot my blood brother's birthday yesterday - This is not what I intend to become. It's *time* that I acively focus on my *mind & body*. Even my parents want me to do so, with their help, I hope to get back in shape.

### Home.

**16th June 2022:** I decided that I will stay home closer to my family and *rebuild* myself.

### No Ordinary Moments.

**22nd May 2022:** Almost two years back I lost my watch & wallet to greed. My brother bought me a brand new watch today.

### Right Place.

**March 2020:** Early in my career after working 1.5 years alone for my own startup I was fortunate enough to realise that it isn't the code that I write keeps me happy; It is the people with whom I write it with.
