## Background

I was reading *[High Performance Python, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-python/9781492055013/)* and a small snippet shown below resonated with me, my thoughts and my hustle since past couple of years.

Hopefully this **list of small yet meaningful wins** will not only bring joy back into my work but also into my life.

### No Ordinary Moments.

**22nd May 2022:** Almost two years back I lost my watch & wallet to greed. My brother bought me a brand new watch today.

### Right Place.

**March 2020:** Early in my career after working 1.5 years alone for my own startup I was fortunate enough to realise - It isn't the code that I write keeps me happy, it is the people with whom I write it with.
